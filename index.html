    <h1>Looking for something to do this Summer? How about swimmimg !!! </h1>
<p>My name is Devesh Verma. I am a certified and experienced swim instructor. I have been in swim teams including Green Hope's and the Hammerheads. I am also getting my lifeguard certification in spring 2018. I enjoy getting the kids started into swimming even if they have never done it before. I'd love to teach your kids swimming </p>
<p>Contact me for scheduling classes.</p>
<p>NOTE: 10% of my earnings will go to <a href="https://sharinghappinesrocks.wixsite.com/share">my charity</a>, which goes to <a href="https://www.durhamrescuemission.org/">Durham Rescue Mission.</a></p>
